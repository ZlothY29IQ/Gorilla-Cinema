The idea for this is to add a little cinema area to watch videos/movies in gtag.
I thought of this idea as i spend alot of my time in vrchat alone watching stuff in popcorn palace because im a loner with no friends... anyways yeah i thought it would be fun to try and add smth like that to Gorilla Tag

Adding custions/ sofas/ bean bags/ beds... just comfy furniture
Add fireplace???

Dynamic back lighting? - May be a bit far out of my knowledge level but ill give it an attempt.

Palce it top floor of shop where theres that random empty space.

Not sure how exactly ill network/sync it with other players yet (if i decide i wanna do that).

You can play most video file formats that you manually place in a folder, or paste a youtube link and stream it.

Thinking of also making a remove, but if i do should i make it like an object you hold in one hand and interact with, with your other hand, or make it on handed by using joystick movements and the trigger button??

I have officially figured out asset bundles successfully because of this

Portable Tablet - You can make it into a small~ish tablet screen with the controlls on the back to maximise space you can watch wherever you fancy?
^ Probably too lazy to do that but atleast the idea is up for consideration

Immersive Aduio - Do i make it mono audio and just come from the screen, or do i make it full spacial audio from where ever. 

Any tips or suggestions im always open to consider.
