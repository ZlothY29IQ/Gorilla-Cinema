The idea for this is to add a little cinema area to watch videos/movies in gtag.

Considering placing it top floor of shop where theres that random empty space.

Not sure how exactly ill network/sync it with other players yet (if i decide i wanna do that).

You can play mp4 files that you manually place in a folder, or paste a youtube link and stream it.

Thinking of also making a remove, but if i do should i make it like an object you hold in one hand and interact with, with your other hand, or make it on handed by using joystick movements and the trigger button??

Im not good at asset bundles yet (still learning) so any help along the way i would GREATLY appreciate.

Immersive Aduio - Do i make it mono audio and just come from the screen, or do i make it full spacial audio from where ever. 

Any tips or suggestions im always open to consider.
